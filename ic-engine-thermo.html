  // Two Stroke and Four Stroke Engines (12 MCQs)
  {
    q: "In a two-stroke engine, power is generated on:",
    options: ["Half revolution", "One revolution of crankshaft", "Two revolutions", "Every stroke"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "A two-stroke engine generates power once per crankshaft revolution, as it completes the cycle in one revolution."
  },
  {
    q: "In a four-stroke cycle engine, the sequence of operation is:",
    options: ["Expansion, compression, suction, exhaust", "Suction, compression, expansion, exhaust", "Compression, suction, exhaust, expansion", "Suction, exhaust, compression, expansion"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The four-stroke cycle follows suction (intake), compression, expansion (power), and exhaust in that order."
  },
  {
    q: "The four operations in a 4-stroke engine are completed in how many crankshaft revolutions?",
    options: ["1", "2", "3", "4"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "A four-stroke engine completes its cycle (suction, compression, expansion, exhaust) in two crankshaft revolutions."
  },
  {
    q: "In a four-stroke engine, which stroke is known as the power stroke?",
    options: ["Compression stroke", "Expansion stroke", "Suction stroke", "Exhaust stroke"],
    answer: 1,
    explanation: "The expansion stroke, where combustion drives the piston, is the power stroke in a four-stroke engine."
